  <p>I started creating websites back in 2023. Since then, I’ve been lucky enough to help people launch their dreams and build the digital tools they need to succeed.</p>
  <p>Currently i worked at <a href="https://oxinos.id" title="Oxinos">Oxinos</a> as senior frontend developer, while dipping my toes into low-level programing and CLI,  
  if you have interesting full stack development or CLI projects, send me an <a href="mailto:jee.nvim@gmail.com" title="Email">email</a>.</p>
