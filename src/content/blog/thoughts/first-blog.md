As you can see from the title, this is my first blog and this post explains why I decided to make it. There are four main reasons:

- I want to get better at writing
- I always have something new to learn
- I want to document how I see and understand things
- Personal branding

Nothing dramatic. Just practical reasons.

## Learning by Explaining to Others

I’m not going to pretend I’m smart. When it comes to understanding new concepts, especially low-level languages or systems-related topics, I struggle a lot.

At some point, I watched a video about learning how to learn. One idea stuck with me: if you can explain something clearly to someone else, you probably understand it. If you can’t, you don’t.

Writing forces me to slow down, organize my thoughts, and confront the parts I don’t understand yet. When I try to explain something and get stuck, that’s a clear signal that I need to go back and learn more.

This blog is basically me talking to myself, but in public.

## I Always Have Something New to Learn

I spend most of my day in front of a screen. While browsing the internet, I often find posts, blogs, or discussions that are genuinely interesting. Sometimes they explain things clearly, sometimes they don’t, but either way they make me think.

Instead of just bookmarking them and forgetting they exist, I want to write about what I learn in my own words. This blog acts as a personal knowledge base. I can come back later, reread my thoughts, and see whether my understanding improved or was completely wrong.

If other people find it useful too, that’s a bonus.

## Writing to Improve Writing

Writing is a skill. I’m bad at it right now, and the only way to get better is to write more and accept that early attempts will be rough.

This blog gives me a reason to practice regularly. Over time, I expect the writing to become clearer, more concise, and less painful to read. If that doesn’t happen, at least the failure will be documented.

## Documenting How I Think

Another reason for this blog is documentation. Not tutorials, not polished guides, but how I personally understand things at a specific point in time.

My opinions will change. My understanding will evolve. Looking back at old posts should make that obvious. That’s intentional.

## Personal Branding

Finally, there’s the practical side. Having a blog helps with visibility. It gives people something to find, read, and judge me by.

If someone searches my name and finds a collection of thoughts, experiments, and explanations instead of nothing, that’s already an improvement.

## Closing

This blog won’t be perfect, consistent, or optimized for everyone. It’s mainly for me. If you get something useful out of it, good. If not, that’s fine too.

The important part is that I started.
